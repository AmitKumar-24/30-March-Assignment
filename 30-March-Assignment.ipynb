    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a statistical technique used to predict the relationship between variables.\n",
    "    It combines the strengths of two popular methods - Ridge and Lasso Regression - to produce more accurate and reliable results. \n",
    "    Elastic Net Regression helps prevent overfitting by including only the most important variables in the model."

    "## Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the optimal values for regularization parameters in Elastic Net Regression involves finding a balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting).\n",
    "    A common approach is to use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different sets of data and select the parameters that provide the best trade-off between\n",

    "\n",
    " Elastic Net Regression is a statistical method that combines the features of both Lasso and Ridge regression. It can handle large datasets and avoids overfitting, \n",
    "    but has a complex parameter tuning process. It helps to find the most important variables in a dataset, but may not work well with highly correlated predictors."
